# TerraformingMarsCompanionApp
An app for helping players maintain their resources when playing the board game terraforming mars.

This is an app developed as the practice assignment for our Object-Oriented Programming course. The aim of the app is not to
replace the physical board game, but to quicken the experience as well as make resource management much more convinient and reduce
mistakes caused by lack of attention.

The app aims to deliver four levels of assistance depending on player preference:

The lowest level has only the resource listing and an opportunity to update resource amounts and production amounts as well as a button
to gain productions after a generation.

The second lowest level is an automated single user mode, where manual resource management is still needed for interaction with other
players and managing resources on cards, but the player can play cards via a search field and the card benefits are applied automatically.

The two highest levels offer identical amounts of assistance, but different amounts of convinience. The first of them is a hot-seat mode
where players pass the phone around the table and basically all resource management, including player interaction, is automated while the
highest level is up to five players connecting to a shared game via a server and getting the aforementioned benefits.

At the moment of writing this readme (15/04/2020) the app is still very much in development on both the server side and the client side
with none of the functions ready. Deadline of the assignment is 08/05/2020, but development, at least by Eddie, will continue after the
assignment is returned.

At the moment the are no plans to release the app in any way or form, only share with some friends after it is ready.
