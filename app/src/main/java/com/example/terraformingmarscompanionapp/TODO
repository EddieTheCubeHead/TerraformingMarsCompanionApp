Road to 1.0:

1 (Done): Change UI queue to stack instead of queue. Move to own class (EventScheduler)
2 (Done): EventScheduler and GameController to static
3 (Done): Clean up UI: everything should preferably be a fragment/dialogue (see how well CardCostDialog works, reliable and reusable)
    - Gonna probably need to do a LOT of work on hex placement. Wanna have hexes, production bonuses etc. rendered
4 (Done): Make everything an event (in EventScheduler). Mainly includes playing cards. Combine WebSocket and Scheduler events.
    - Get rid of hacky way of implementing things like corporation choice with multiple use actions.
        - UseAction event. Add to the bottom of the event stack, data about whether to end turn or use action. Clean and simple
    - Gonna need to rewrite the cards a lot
    - WebSocketPackets and GameEvents have not been merged. Will have another look at that once UI is
      fully revamped so I know exactly how all events will function
5 (Done): Implement javadoc in all game logic classes.
6 (Done): Clean up card system. The game only needs one deck, do everything else with filtering.
7 (Done): Clean up the Player class. Move resources to a data class with small utility functions?
8 (Done): Finish the scoring system

9/10: Hex UI improvement by Softgitron
9/10: Implement the rest of Corporate era, Preludes and Hellas & Elysium functionality and improve
      code functionality
    - Robotic workforce (probably needs a new type of event)
    - Viral enhancers (imitate manutech and aquifer pumping)
    - Map selection in game creation
    - Implement all preludes
    - Implement algorithm to check adjacent owned place requirements in advance (greeneries, mining area)
    - Use Exceptions to deliver more precise info about why an action is not possible
    - Serializing game (via GameState -object) and undo move -button
11: Server functionality improvements
    - Error handling for losing connection
    - Email functionality for user creation and password handling
    - (Save/Load games from server)
12: UI revamps
    - Ability to observe other people's resources
    - Condense the rest of ingame UI views into a single Activity with multiple fragments
    - Ease of use : greeneries and raising temperature from main view by clicking resources
13: Anything urgent that comes up
14: Cleanup the best I can
    - Standardize Events and Packets
        - Possibly differentiate producers and consumers more clearly
        - Either have all consumers only have corresponding Packet as data or merge packets and consumers
    - Cleanup filtering code
        - Either needs to be split into smaller classes or find a way to reuse code more in the current class
    - Cards in recyclerviews randomly gain more tags when scrolling up and down: needs fixing

After 1.0, in no particular order:

 - Incorporate the event changes to the server so every move can be saved for analysis later
 - Add systems that support the expansions
 - Add the expansion cards
 - Make the app able to funtion when only one player in a game uses it
    - UI needs a lot of thought, especially card resources
 - Expand user functionality, include statistics etc. and revision not-ingame UI
 - Flavor/information texts for cards, via android string resource

Some general ideas for future:

 - Some tongue in cheek achievment system
 - Use android localization resources for card names to prevent typos
