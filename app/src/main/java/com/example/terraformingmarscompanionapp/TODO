Assignment over, let's go. Rewrite everything.

The big change, in parts:

1 (Done): Change UI queue to stack instead of queue. Move to own class (EventScheduler)
2 (Done): EventScheduler and GameController to static
3 (Done): Clean up UI: everything should preferably be a fragment/dialogue (see how well CardCostDialog works, reliable and reusable)
    - Gonna probably need to do a LOT of work on hex placement. Wanna have hexes, production bonuses etc. rendered
4 (Done): Make everything an event (in EventScheduler). Mainly includes playing cards. Combine WebSocket and Scheduler events.
    - Get rid of hacky way of implementing things like corporation choice with multiple use actions.
        - UseAction event. Add to the bottom of the event stack, integer whether one or two actions. Clean and simple
    - Gonna need to rewrite the cards a lot
    - WebSocketPackets and GameEvents have not been merged. Will have another look at that once UI is
      fully revamped so I know exactly how all events will function
5: Incorporate android's string holders as card names (later everything).
    - Gets rid of typos and is cleaner.
6: Clean up card system. The game only needs one deck, do everything else with filtering.
7: Clean up the Player class. Move resources to a data class with small utility functions?
8: Finish the scoring system

Taking a break from the main rewrites to try and improve overall code quality:

 - Study Java comment practices/JavaDoc. Actually comment all the code properly
   - Need to decide how to represent versions as numbers. Assignment return version cannot be 1.0,
     it was incomplete as can be.
     - The current vision is consider "1.0" to be the version where I would myself feel like using this
       with the game is beneficial and include basegame and corporate era functionality
     - Think I am just gonna call assignment return version 0.1 and the current version (27/05/2020)
       0.2. I think 1.0 is like 6-8 branch-merge cycles away:
        1/2: Docs, testing and cleanup (0.3)
        1/2: Roni's hex UI rewrite (0.3)
        3: Corporate era special case implementation (0.4)
        4: Serverside changes, error handling, rejoining, game loading etc. (0.5)
        5: UI revamps (0.6)
        (6-7): For anything that comes up during the development
        8: Finalization and cleanup (1.0)
 - Reformat at least UI classes into proper folders. Have a look at the overall folder structure as well
 - Study and implement testing the best I can.

After rewrite, in no particular order:

 - Bigger UI revision
    - Everything from outside the game
 - Incorporate the event changes to the server so every move can be saved for analysis later
 - Add systems that support the expansions
 - Add the expansion cards
 - Make the app able to funtion when only one player in a game uses it
    - UI needs a lot of thought, especially card resources
 - Flavor/information texts for cards, via android string resource

Some general fun ideas:

 - Some tongue in cheek achievment system
